## Highlights

1. Since social media is regarded as the new TV, Twitter has the potential to influence its users' political views.
2. As the election season has only begun, the presidentiables have yet to leverage their Twitter presence.
3. Each presidential candidate has distinct topics, styles, and word choices in their tweets.
4. The candidatesâ€™ followers value original and personalized content, as well as an uninterrupted Twitter experience.
5. Interpretability methods allow for a clear grasp of the business value of model outcomes.
